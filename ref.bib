 abstract = {Some new diagnostic measures in discriminant analysis are proposed. They can be expressed in terms of the two fundamental influence statistics in discriminant analysis: d2 i and ψ̂i. A theorem on the asymptotic distributions of the fundamental statistics is derived. Based on the theorem, the proposed measures can be shown to be asymptotically distributed as functions of independent chi-squared and standard normal random variables. Critical values and expected quantiles of the measures can then be constructed. Hence influential observations are detected using Q-Q plots and significance tests. Two measures have analogous forms in regression. The theorem is also useful for getting the asymptotic distributions of existing measures that are functions of d2 i and ψ̂i. A comparison of the diagnostics in linear discriminant analysis, linear regression, and linear logistic regression (discriminant) analysis is made. Although discriminant coefficients can be determined under a regression model, regression diagnostic measures are shown to be inappropriate for detecting influential observations in linear discriminant analysis. The temptation of applying regression diagnostic measures in linear discriminant analysis must be resisted.},

	abstract = {The Congruent Matching Cells (CMC) method was invented at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for accurate ﬁrearm evidence identiﬁcation and error rate estimation. The CMC method is based on the principle of discretization. The toolmark image of the reference sample is divided into correlation cells. Each cell is registered to the cell-sized area of the compared image that has maximum surface topography similarity. For each resulting cell pair, one parameter quantiﬁes the similarity of the cell surface topography and three parameters quantify the pattern congruency of the registration position and orientation. An identiﬁcation (declared match) requires a signiﬁcant number of CMCs, that is, cell pairs that meet both similarity and pattern congruency requirements. The use of cell correlations reduces the effects of “invalid regions” in the compared image pairs and increases the correlation accuracy. The identiﬁcation accuracy of the CMC method can be further improved by considering a feature named “convergence,” that is, the tendency of the x–y registration positions of the correlated cell pairs to converge at the correct registration angle when comparing same-source samples at different relative orientations. In this paper, the difference of the convergence feature between known matching (KM) and known non-matching (KNM) image pairs is characterized, based on which an improved algorithm is developed for breech face image correlations using the CMC method. Its advantage is demonstrated by comparison with three existing CMC algorithms using four datasets. The datasets address three different brands of consecutively manufactured pistol slides, with signiﬁcant differences in the distribution overlap of cell pair topography similarity for KM and KNM image pairs. For the same CMC threshold values, the convergence algorithm demonstrates noticeably improved results by reducing the number of false-positive or false-negative CMCs in a comparison.},

	abstract = {When a gun is fired, it leaves marks on cartridge cases that are thought to be unique to the gun. In current practice, firearms examiners inspect cartridge cases for “sufficient agreement,” in which case they conclude that they come from the same gun, testifying in courts as such. A 2016 President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology report questioned the scientific validity of such analysis (President’s Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology, Washington, DC, Executive Office of the President). One recommendation was to convert firearms analysis to an objective method. We propose a fully automated, open-source method for comparing breechface marks on cartridge cases using 2D optical images. We improve on existing methodology by automating the selection of marks, and removing the effects of circular symmetry. We propose an empirical computation of a “random match probability” given a known database, which can be used to quantify the weight of evidence. We demonstrate an improvement in accuracy on images from controlled test fires.},

	abstract = {The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has proposed a “NIST Ballistics Identification System (NBIS)” to facilitate accurate ballistics identifications and fast evidence searches [1]. The NBIS will use three-dimensional (3D) topography measurements for ballistics identification and evidence searches. The 3D topographies will be subdivided into arrays of correlation cells in order to help identify “valid correlation areas” and eliminate “invalid correlation areas” from the matching and identification procedure. “Synchronous processing” is proposed for correlating dozens or even hundreds of cell pairs at the same time. Based on the concept of correlation cells, a “Contiguous Matching Cells (CMC)” method using three identification parameters of the paired correlation cells (cross correlation function maximum CCFmax, spatial registration position in x-y and registration angle θ) is proposed for high accuracy ballistics identifications. Based on the proposed CMC method, a “National Ballistics Evidence Search Engine (NBESE)” is also proposed for fast and accurate ballistics evidence searches.},

	abstract = {The Miami-Dade Police Department Crime Laboratory conducted a research study on the repeatability and uniqueness of striations/impressions on fired cartridge casings fired in 10 consecutively manufactured 9mm Ruger slides to improve understanding of the accuracy, reliability, and measurement validity in the firearm and tool mark discipline of forensic science. The foundation of firearm and tool mark identification is that each firearm/tool produces a signature of identification (striation/impression) that is unique to that firearm/tool, and through the examination of the individual striations/impressions, the signature can be positively identified to the firearm/tool that produced it. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Report questioned the repeatability and uniqueness of striations/impressions left on fired evidence as well as the validity and error rate in firearms identification. This study analyzed the repeatability and uniqueness of striations/impressions on fired cartridge cases fired in 10 consecutively manufactured Ruger slides by analyzing breech face striations/impressions through an evaluation of the participants’ accuracy in making correct identifications. One semi-automatic pistol and nine additional consecutively manufactured slides were utilized. Consecutively manufactured slides are significant to this study because they were manufactured with the same equipment/tools, one right after the other. Even though these slides were consecutively made, their signatures should be different. Test sets included test fired casings from each slide, as well as unknowns. Participants were firearm \& tool mark examiners throughout the United States. One hundred and fifty-eight test sets were distributed to laboratories in forty-six states and the District of Columbia. The test sets were designed to determine an examiner’s ability to correctly identify unknown cartridge casings fired from 10 consecutively manufactured Ruger Slides to test fired cartridge casings fired from the same slides. This empirical study established an error rate of less than 0.1 percent. Durability testing established that the Ruger Slides maintained their individual signature after multiple firings.},
